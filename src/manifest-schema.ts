 * A namespace becomes a path component (`skills/<namespace>/`,
 * `agents/<namespace>/`, `learnings/<namespace>/`), so it may not escape the
 * directory it names. Nothing else about it is constrained: it is a directory
 * name, so any name a filesystem accepts — non-ASCII, or holding a space —
 * stays valid. (A project id is narrower still, because it is also typed on the
 * command line; that guard lives with the project schema.)
