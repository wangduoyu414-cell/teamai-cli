 * process_exit, since a PID-fallback ID comes back for a later run; each run
 * is returned under its own ID (see {@link adoptBareKeys}). It is
 * decided once, whole, by its first event keyed with a data home
 * (`dataHomeKey`, or the path an unreleased build of #795 wrote), because a
 * Stop carries the whole transcript's totals: split per event, a session that
 * moved into another scope would count there again the part recorded before
 * the move. A project also owns the key of its in-repo `.teamai`, where a
 * hook recorded until migration moved the project to a partition. A session
 * written before events carried a key is decided by its first cwd, by the
 * dispatcher's rule: the scope that directory resolves to now, so a nested
 * clone under a project is not the project's; one with no cwd, or a cwd gone
 * since, is no scope's. A tool's own session ID a scope has recorded as its
 * own (see `session-owners.jsonl`) is that scope's, whatever the log still
 * holds. A caller without a scope config reads the whole log.
