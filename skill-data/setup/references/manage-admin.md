# Scenario: Admin — day-to-day management

The user already ran `teamai init`. Do NOT re-init or re-register. Before changing
anything, say what you are about to change. Pick the task below that matches.

Day-to-day management is mostly **publishing and updating team resources — skills,
rules, MCP servers, and env** — plus inviting members and checking the dashboard.

## Publish or update a skill / rule / doc

The user (or you) creates or edits a skill, rule, or doc locally, then publishes it
to the team. The same `teamai push` handles both new resources and updates to
existing ones:

```bash
teamai push            # review the diff, then confirm
teamai push --all      # push everything without per-item confirmation
teamai push --skill <path>   # push one specific skill
teamai push --branch <name> # use an explicit branch for a new push
```

An existing open PR is updated on its recorded branch. TeamAI refuses to reset a
team-repo clone with unrelated modified, staged, untracked, or conflicted files;
commit or stash those changes before retrying.

Members receive it automatically the next time they open a session (or when they
run `teamai pull`).

## Publish or update team MCP servers

```bash
teamai mcp list        # team MCP servers + per-tool install status
teamai mcp inject      # push team MCP servers into every AI tool's config
teamai mcp remove      # remove teamai-managed MCP servers
```

MCP definitions travel with the team repo like skills/rules — edit, then the
members pick them up on sync.

## Invite a member

There is **no CLI invite flag.** Inviting is done on the Git platform's website:

1. On the platform (GitHub / GitLab / CNB), add the person to the team repo
   (Settings → Collaborators / Members).
2. Send them the **full repo URL** and this line to paste into their AI tool:
   `/teamai Help me join my team's TeamAI, repo URL is <URL>`

(If you want to see who is already registered: `teamai members` /
`teamai members list`.)

## See members and resources

```bash
teamai members list          # registered team members
teamai list                  # all resource types
teamai list skills           # just skills
teamai status                # local vs team differences
```

## Roles (skill namespaces per job function)

```bash
teamai roles list            # roles defined + your current role
teamai roles init            # create the roles manifest (admin, interactive)
teamai roles add <id>        # add a role
teamai roles update <id>     # change a role's namespaces / description
teamai roles remove <id>     # remove a role
```

After editing roles, `teamai push` to publish the manifest. Members re-sync on
their next session.

## Projects (manage several projects from one repo)

`project` is a second dispatch dimension alongside `role` — one team repo can serve
multiple projects, each with its own skills/rules/learnings, without a separate
repo per project:

```bash
teamai projects list         # projects defined + the ones active in this directory
teamai projects set [ids...]     # set the active project(s) for this directory
teamai projects members <id> # who is registered on a project
teamai projects add <id> --namespaces common,<id>   # add a project (creates projects.yaml if needed)
teamai projects update <id> --add-namespaces <ns>   # or --remove-namespaces / --name / --description
teamai projects remove <id>  # remove a project
```

A member gets the union of their role resources and their active project's
resources. Admins declare projects in `manifest/projects.yaml` with the commands
above, each of which opens a PR (`--dry-run` previews). After `projects remove`,
keep the project's content in the team repo until members have pulled: that is
what lets their next pull clean up the copies they deployed.

Every namespace that names a directory — `knowledge`, `skills`, `agents`, `env`,
`hooks`, `mcp`, `models` and `docs` in either manifest, and `learnings` in `projects.yaml` (a role's `learnings:` is
ignored and unchecked) — must be a single path segment: no `/`, `\`, `:` or control character, no trailing
`.` or space, and not a Windows device name (`CON`, `NUL`, `COM1`, …). `team-codebase`
cannot be a `docs` namespace (`docs/team-codebase/` is the legacy codebase output). Two
namespaces of one resource type may not differ only by case, across both
manifests. A manifest that breaks this, does not parse, or is empty stops
members' pull for that scope until it is fixed; the error names the entry. Fix
it rather than deleting it — with no `roles.yaml`, delivery is unfiltered.

An item in an active namespace replaces the root item of the same name, whole:
a skill by directory name (including a root skill a member gets through a tag),
an agent by file stem, a rule by first-level file name (`rules/<ns>/<name>.md`
replaces `rules/<name>.md`), and a `claudemd/<ns>/<name>.md` file replaces
`claudemd/<name>.md`. Use this to give a project its own version of a shared
item under the same name, and keep that shared item at the root rather than in
a namespace every role activates: `rules/code-style.md` is replaced by
`rules/checkout/code-style.md` for checkout members, while a
`rules/common/code-style.md` would reach them alongside it. The same skill or
agent name in two namespaces one member has active is an error naming both
files; two namespace rules or claudemd files of one name are both delivered.
A replacement must be usable to replace anything: a skill directory needs its
`SKILL.md` (pull names one without it), and while an agent file does not parse
the root agent stays installed. `teamai doctor` lists each replacement as a note. Teams without roles or
projects are unaffected.

Docs have no override. A top-level `docs/<ns>/` that any role or project lists
under `resources.docs` reaches only members with that namespace active; a
`docs/<dir>/` nobody lists stays shared with everyone. When a member leaves the
namespace, their next pull removes its docs that still match the team copy and
keeps (and names) the ones they edited. Recall and `teamai doctor` follow the
same filter.

## Team dashboard (web UI)

```bash
teamai dashboard             # start the AI coding session dashboard (default port 3721)
teamai dashboard --port 8080 # custom port
```

Opens a local web UI for team coding-session activity and knowledge-base health.

## Team packages (npm + Claude plugins)

Declare packages once; members get a prompt to install them (TeamAI never runs
third-party package code automatically):

```bash
teamai packages install typescript          # npm dependency
teamai packages install eslint@latest --global   # global CLI tool
teamai packages install code-review@claude-plugins-official   # Claude plugin
teamai push                                 # share the updated teamai.yaml
```

## Shared environment variables, hooks and MCP servers

```bash
teamai env list              # what reaches this directory, each with its namespace (values masked)
teamai env list --reveal     # show values in plaintext
teamai env add <KEY> <VALUE> # add or update in env/env.yaml
teamai env add <KEY> <VALUE> --project <id>   # or --role <ns>: in that namespace's env/<ns>/env.yaml (warns if nothing declares <ns>)
teamai env remove <KEY>      # remove (same --role / --project)
teamai remove mcp <name>     # root mcp/mcp.yaml if it has the name, else the one namespace file; --role / --project pick a namespace
```

Env variables, team hooks and MCP servers are scoped like skills: the root file
(`env/env.yaml`, `hooks/hooks.yaml`, `mcp/mcp.yaml`) reaches everyone, and
`env/<ns>/env.yaml`, `hooks/<ns>/hooks.yaml`, `mcp/<ns>/mcp.yaml` reach only
members whose role or project lists `<ns>` under `resources.env`, `resources.hooks`
or `resources.mcp`. A namespace entry replaces the root entry of the same key, hook
id or server name. Hooks and MCP servers have no add command, and `teamai push`
does not pick up `hooks/` or `mcp/`: edit the file in the team repo, then commit
and push it with git. `teamai doctor` lists each override.

- A name twice in one file, in two active namespaces, or an active file that does
  not parse: that type is not applied for affected members and their installed
  state is kept. Fix the file the warning names. A hooks or MCP file with none of
  its top-level keys (`server:` for `servers:`) counts as one that does not parse.
- Per-entry `projects:` (and `roles:` on env) no longer works: such an entry reaches
  nobody. `roles:` on hooks and MCP still filters for one more minor release. Pull
  and `teamai doctor` name the namespace file each entry belongs in; move it there.
- An env, hook or MCP entry with a key its schema does not know (a mistyped `role:`)
  also reaches nobody. Pull and `teamai doctor` name the file, entry and key; correct
  the key or remove it. A key a later teamai version adds is unknown to an older one,
  so upgrade every member before the team uses a new entry key.
- Team model profiles work the same way: `models/<ns>/models.yaml`, declared under
  `resources.models`, replaces the root profile with the same `id` for members who
  have `<ns>` active. A member's API key is bound to the profile's gateway origin:
  when an override points at another host, their pull leaves the agent alone and
  asks them to run `teamai models switch team:<id>` to set the key for it.
- Have every member upgrade before declaring `env`, `hooks`, `mcp`, `models` or `docs` in a
  manifest: teamai 0.25.0 and the 0.26.0 betas reject those keys and their pull stops.

## When sync fails

Run `teamai doctor` first. If it reports hook or path problems, load
the troubleshooting reference (`"$(teamai skill path core)/references/troubleshooting.md"`). Have the affected member reopen their session; if their tool
has no session-start hook, they run `teamai pull` manually.

## Capture a lesson learned

Turning a tricky fix into team knowledge is **automatic** once recall is on for
the team (`sharing.recall.enabled: true` in `teamai.yaml`, then `teamai push`; it is
off by default, and `teamai recall enable` turns it on for one machine only): at the end of a session
worth sharing, TeamAI prompts the member and the dedicated
`share` workflow (`teamai skill get share`) summarizes the session and runs
`teamai contribute`. Nobody has to invoke it by hand. (A member whose teamai config
cannot be loaded gets no prompt; `teamai skill get share` names the file and the error.)
(Publishing a **reusable skill** someone authored is a different task — any member
can do it, see `"$(teamai skill path core)/references/contribute-member.md"`.)

### Turn the sharing prompt on or off (admin)

The auto-share prompt is **on by default once recall is on**, and only shows in directories set up
with teamai (never on a read-only HTTP source, or while a member's teamai config cannot be loaded).
To disable it team-wide, set this in
`teamai.yaml` and `teamai push`:

```yaml
sharing:
  contributeHint:
    enabled: false      # team-wide default; members can still override locally
```

Resolution order: `TEAMAI_CONTRIBUTE_HINT_DISABLED=1` env kill switch > a member's
local override > this team setting > default (on). Turning it off here only removes
the nudge; members can still contribute on request.

## Don't

- Don't hand-run raw `git` commands.
- Don't create a second team repo.
- Don't use `owner/repo` short form — always the full URL.
