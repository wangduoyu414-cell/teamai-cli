# teamai — daily workflow

You are guiding a user through TeamAI. **They may not know Git.** You run the
commands; they only make choices when you ask. Follow the steps literally —
do not skip, reorder, or invent commands.

## Start here

Look at what the user typed after `/teamai`.

**If they gave NO scenario right after a TeamAI friction reminder** (the
`[teamai]` line that suggests `/teamai share what this session taught me`),
that reminder is the scenario: load `teamai skill get share` and follow it.

**If they gave NO scenario otherwise** (bare `/teamai`, or only greetings/no task):
print the menu below **exactly**, then **STOP and wait**. Take no other action —
do not run any command, do not load another skill yet.

```
teamai — Team AI Skills & Rules Sync

Usage examples (copy one to get started):

  🏗️  Admin — set up a new team repo:
      /teamai Help me set up TeamAI for my team from scratch

  🤝  Member — join an existing team:
      /teamai Help me join my team's TeamAI, repo URL is https://...

  🔧  Admin — daily management (publish & update skills, rules, MCP, env):
      /teamai I already have TeamAI set up, help me manage it

  📊  Anyone — open the team dashboard:
      /teamai Open the TeamAI dashboard

  💡  Member — share a skill with the team (just ask in plain language):
      /teamai Share this <skill-name> skill with my team

  🗑️  Anyone — remove TeamAI from this machine:
      /teamai Uninstall TeamAI
```

**If they DID describe a scenario**, match it to one row and follow what it loads.

| The user wants to…                                                    | Load this                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Set up a team from scratch, join a team, manage one, or uninstall      | `teamai skill get setup`                       |
| Publish a skill, rule or doc they already have                         | `{SKILL_DIR}/references/contribute-member.md`  |
| Share what this session taught them                                    | `teamai skill get share`                       |
| Understand a large multi-repo codebase, build an architecture wiki     | `teamai skill get wiki`                        |
| Sync now, see differences, diagnose                                    | `teamai pull` · `teamai status` · `teamai doctor` |
| Open the team dashboard                                                | `teamai dashboard` — it starts a local server (default port 3721); give the user the URL |
| Something broke                                                        | `{SKILL_DIR}/references/troubleshooting.md`    |

If the request is ambiguous (e.g. "help me with teamai" with no direction),
ask ONE short question to pick a row, then proceed.

Sharing a session's learnings needs no menu choice: TeamAI prompts on its own at
the end of a session that produced something worth sharing, and that prompt means
`teamai skill get share`. (Only when recall is on; it is off by default. The team turns it on with
`sharing.recall.enabled: true` in `teamai.yaml`, a member with `teamai recall enable`;
while it is off, or while the teamai config cannot be loaded, `teamai skill get share`
says so and why.)

## Global rules

1. **Reply in the user's language — including every example and hand-off blurb.**
   Answer in whatever language the user used, for the whole conversation. This
   applies to **everything you write**: the invite line you give an admin to
   forward, the one-line explanations, the "what's next" summary — all of it is
   translated before you show it. *Only* commands, flags, URLs, file paths and
   code identifiers stay verbatim (never translate `teamai pull`, `--scope user`,
   `/teamai`, a repo URL).
2. **Never teach Git.** Do not mention branches, commits, clone, or push/pull of
   Git itself. TeamAI hides all of that. The user thinks in terms of "my team's
   skills", not repositories.
3. **You run the commands.** Only pause to ask the user when you need a web login,
   a value only they know, or a genuine either/or choice. Show each command before
   you run it, in one short line.
4. **Detect the current AI tool first.** TeamAI behaves differently per host. Note
   which tool this conversation is running in (Claude Code, Cursor, CodeBuddy,
   WorkBuddy, ChatGPT App, Codex, OpenCode, Kiro, Gemini CLI, …). When you reopen a
   session, use the name of **this** tool — do not assume Claude Code or Cursor.
   Some hosts need extra manual steps for hooks — see the troubleshooting
   reference ("Agent-specific caveats").

## Daily commands

```bash
teamai pull        # Sync team resources into local AI tools now
teamai push        # Publish your local skills/rules/docs to the team
teamai status      # Show local vs team differences
teamai doctor      # Diagnose configuration and hook problems
teamai list        # List resources (skills|rules|docs|env|agents|hooks|mcp)
teamai recall <q>  # Search what the team has already learned
```

Every other command, every flag, and the flags `--help` hides live in the
generated reference below. Read it instead of guessing a flag.

`teamai pull` mirrors the non-hidden docs you receive into `sharing.docs.localDir`,
removing stale and local-only documents; an edited doc of a docs namespace you left
is kept and named. Use a dedicated directory; preview with `--dry-run`.

## References

In the files below, `{SKILL_DIR}` is the directory `teamai skill path core` prints; a reference file you open on its own writes that directory as `SKILL_DIR` in braces.

| File | When to load it |
|---|---|
| `{SKILL_DIR}/references/commands.md` | Before using any command not in the daily list, or any flag. Generated from the CLI's own command table, so it cannot drift. |
| `{SKILL_DIR}/references/troubleshooting.md` | A command fails, a hook does not fire, or a host needs manual steps. |
| `{SKILL_DIR}/references/contribute-member.md` | A member wants to publish a skill, rule or doc they already have. Any member can, not just admins. |

`teamai skill get core --full` prints this skill with all three references
appended. Load a single file above when you only need one.
