/**
 * Manage a long-lived teamai orphan branch through an isolated git worktree.
 *
 * Two branches are built on this: `teamai-reports` (members/sessions/votes/stats)
 * and `teamai-learnings` (learnings). They must not share a branch, a worktree
 * or a lock, and everything else about them is identical, so a spec of three
 * names is the whole difference.
 *
 * Worktree placement:
 *  - self: <dataHome>/<dirname>, in the partition, so every checkout of the
 *    business repo shares it (#808)
 *  - git / legacy: sibling of the clone (`<dirname(localPath)>/<dirname>`) so
 *    clone `reset --hard` cannot nest-destroy it
 *
 * Why an orphan branch + dedicated worktree?
 *  - High-frequency data must NOT pollute the default branch, so members can use
 *    the team repo with branch protection. An orphan history leaves main clean.
 *  - Writes involve `git reset --hard` / rebase. Running those on the user's
 *    active working tree (self) or nesting the worktree inside the knowledge
 *    clone (git) would destroy uncommitted work. A separate worktree confines
 *    every destructive git op to the orphan-branch checkout.
 *
 * Concurrency: the branch is shared by the whole team. Pushes race at the git
 * layer (non-fast-forward); we resolve with fetch + rebase + retry. Reports
 * never collide because each member only writes `<user>.yaml`; learnings can,
 * which is why a publish reports whether the ref actually moved.
