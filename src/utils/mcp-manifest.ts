/**
 * Load a project worktree's own managed-MCP manifest, migrating this worktree's
 * ownership records out of any pre-#374 shared file on first read.
 *
 * Each worktree now has its OWN file at
 * `<dataHome>/workspaces/<workspaceId>/managed-mcp.json` (see
 * managedMcpManifestPath). This removes the two hazards of a single shared file
 * in the partition: cross-worktree ownership bleed and lost updates under
 * concurrent read-modify-write.
 *
 * Compatibility: older installs kept everything in the shared
 * `<dataHome>/managed-mcp.json`, keyed by `<tool>:project` (or the interim
 * `<tool>:project:<id>`). When this worktree has no per-worktree file yet, we lift
 * the records belonging to THIS worktree out of the shared file:
 *  - a bare `<tool>:project` key is claimed only when the data home is
 *    workspace-local (legacy `<workspaceRoot>/.teamai`), where it is unambiguous;
 *  - a `<tool>:project:<thisWorkspaceId>` key is always this worktree's.
 *
 * Migration is made DURABLE here, independent of the caller: we first atomically
 * write the per-worktree destination file, and only AFTER that succeeds do we
 * best-effort remove the claimed keys from the shared file. Persisting inside the
 * loader (rather than relying on the caller to save) is required because callers
 * may be read-only (report) or may skip their write when nothing changed
 * (`reconcile` with `wrote === false`) — removing the source first in those cases
 * would orphan the records. Ordering (destination first, source second) means a
 * crash between the two leaves the records readable in BOTH files, never neither.
 *
 * `dryRun` suppresses all writes (preview): the migrated records are returned in
 * memory but neither file is touched.
 *
 * Returns the per-worktree manifest path plus its loaded contents. Callers mutate
 * `manifest` and persist with `saveProjectMcpManifest`.
