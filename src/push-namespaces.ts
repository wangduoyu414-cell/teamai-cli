 * Namespace placement for `teamai push`.

 * root: `skills/<ns>/<name>/`, `rules/<ns>/<name>.md`, `agents/<ns>/<name>.yaml`.
 * `pull` filters each of those against the member's active namespaces, and a
 * resource written to the shared root ships to everyone.
 *
 * Push therefore has to decide, per resource type, which namespace a brand-new
 * resource lands in. That decision used to be inlined in `pushCore` for skills
 * alone, which is why a rule or an agent pushed with `--role`/`--project` still
 * reached the whole team (issue #649). It lives here so every type answers the
 * same question the same way, and so the answer can be tested without a repo.
