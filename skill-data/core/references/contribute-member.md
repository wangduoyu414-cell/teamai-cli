# Scenario: Member — publish a reusable skill

Goal: the user turns something they built into team knowledge everyone can pull.
**Any member can do this — you do not need to be an admin.** The usual entry point
is the user just asking in plain language, e.g. *"share this xxx skill with my
team"*, in whatever language they work in.

**Publishing is a team-visible action — confirm before you run it.** A plain
worded request tells you *what* the user wants, not that they are ready to push
it to everyone. Before `teamai push` / `teamai contribute`, show exactly what
will be shared (which skill or file, and that it goes to the whole team) and get
an explicit go-ahead. Do not publish from an offhand mention of "sharing" in
ordinary conversation — only when the user has clearly asked to publish *this*
thing now.

## Which kind of contribution?

- **A learning** (a lesson, a gotcha, how you solved something) → this is
  **automatic** once recall is on (off by default) and the teamai config loads: TeamAI prompts at the end of a session worth sharing and the
  dedicated `share` workflow (`teamai skill get share`) takes over (it summarizes the
  session and runs `teamai contribute`). The user does not come through this flow
  for it. (Step A below is only a manual fallback for while recall is off.)
- **A reusable skill** (a `SKILL.md` others invoke) → author the skill, then
  `teamai push` (Step B — the main purpose of this reference).

## Step A — Contribute a learning by hand (fallback only)

> Prefer the `share` workflow (`teamai skill get share`). Use these manual steps only while
> it refuses because recall is off.

1. Write a short Markdown doc that captures the lesson. Keep it concrete and
   actionable — a knowledge base, not a diary. Include YAML frontmatter for search
   indexing:

   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "<short title of the problem or finding>"
   author: <username>
   date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
   tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
   ---

   ## Background
   What were you doing? What went wrong?

   ## Solution
   How did you fix it? Key steps.

   ## Takeaways
   - Lesson 1
   - Lesson 2
   ```

2. Save it to a temp file, then push it to the team:

   ```bash
   teamai contribute --file /tmp/my-learning.md --title "K8s pod startup timeout"
   ```

The doc lands in the team's `learnings/` and appears for teammates on their next
`teamai pull`. It is also searchable via `teamai recall`.

In an autocode managed-resource installation with Recall disabled, `pull` only
syncs static resources and their index. It preserves local learning files and
unpublished drafts without publishing or mirroring knowledge. Native upstream
installations keep their existing knowledge synchronization behavior.

> Tip: while recall is on, `teamai skill get share` auto-summarizes the current
> session instead of you writing the doc by hand.

## Step B — Contribute a reusable skill

1. Create the skill directory with a `SKILL.md`:

   ```
   skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
   ```

   Minimal frontmatter:

   ```markdown
   ---
   name: my-skill
   description: "One line — what it does and when to use it"
   ---

   # My Skill

   Step-by-step instructions the AI should follow.
   ```

2. Publish it:

   ```bash
   teamai push --skill skills/my-skill        # one skill
   # or
   teamai push                                # review and push everything
   ```

   To publish into a specific role namespace: `teamai push --skill <path> --role <id>`.
   `--role <ns>` / `--project <id>` place every new resource, not only skills: a
   new rule and a new agent land in that namespace too (a project resolves each
   from its own axis — `knowledge` for rules, `agents` for agents). Without one,
   a new resource whose namespace cannot be resolved stays at the shared root and
   reaches the whole team. An edit of a skill, rule or agent you received from a
   namespace goes back to that namespace, even when it replaces a shared item of
   the same name; the shared one is left as it is. Use `--branch <name>` when a new push must target a
   specific branch; an existing open PR keeps its recorded branch. TeamAI refuses
   to reset a team-repo clone with user changes, so commit or stash unrelated
   modified, staged, untracked, or conflicted files before retrying.

   In single-repo mode, a skill or rule under `.teamai/` that matches an older
   version of the team's file, as it does when the branch is behind the default
   branch, is skipped with a warning that it "is an older version of" that file:
   pushing it would revert a teammate's update. To publish an edit of it, bring
   the current version in first (`git fetch origin && git merge origin/<default>`,
   or copy the team's current file over it), redo the edit on top, and push again.

## After contributing

- Confirm it landed: `teamai list skills` (or `teamai status`).
- Teammates receive it automatically on their next session, or via `teamai pull`.

Before listing rules, `push` refreshes copies whose bodies still match a recorded
sync revision. Copilot's generated `applyTo` header does not count as a local
edit: unedited old instructions update in native format, including under
`COPILOT_HOME` in user scope. Genuine local body edits remain push candidates.
Rule pre-sync leaves tools excluded by `enabledAgents` or `disabledAgents` untouched.
When only team `paths` change, `applyTo` refreshes if the local file still matches
a recorded version's generated copy; locally edited headers are kept.

## If push is denied

A permission error usually means you don't have write access to the team repo.
Copy the exact error to your admin and ask them to grant access. (In read-only
HTTP mode, `contribute` / `push` are not available — you can only consume.)
