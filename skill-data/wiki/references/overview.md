# wiki: AI cognition engineering for large codebases

> TeamAI built-in skill. The methodology, scripts and agent specifications are **not** copied into `.claude/`, `.codebuddy/`, `.cursor/` or any other agent directory: they ship inside the installed CLI and are served on demand by `teamai skill get wiki` (`--full` for the references too). What an agent reads therefore always matches the CLI it is running. `teamai skill path wiki` prints the directory that holds the scripts and templates, for the commands below that run them. TeamAI ships no separate team-wiki CLI, and no extra plugin is required.

## Why this skill exists

The AI comprehension problem of large projects:

| Pain point | Symptom |
|------|---------|
| **Context does not fit** | 10+ repositories and hundreds of thousands of lines of code, far beyond the AI context window |
| **Relations are unclear** | RPC/MQ/DB dependencies between microservices are scattered across repositories with no global view |
| **Rules are not remembered** | Business constraints, state machines and config parameters hide deep in call chains |
| **Answers are inaccurate** | AI sees only local code, lacks global architecture awareness, and hallucinates easily |
| **High token consumption** | Every question re-reads large amounts of source, which is very inefficient |

## How it is solved

Architecture reverse-engineering **compresses the huge codebase into a structured knowledge base**:

- Every conclusion has a code `file:line` as evidence
- Every component relation carries a confidence label (`EXTRACTED` / `INFERRED` / `AMBIGUOUS`)
- Every generation run produces accuracy statistics, with automatic warnings when thresholds are exceeded
- AI reads the knowledge base instead of the source and gains global architecture awareness for **about 1/50 of the tokens**
- In Phase 0, `teamai codebase --extract` can generate evidence-backed structural edges (TS/JS/Python/Go/Swift AST + multi-language heuristics)
- After extraction, `teamai codebase --deep-enrich --project <slug> --output <repo>` can generate deterministic graph documents (G1/G2/G3) and deep knowledge; no separate team-wiki CLI is needed

## Execution flow

```
Phase 0  → Initialisation: collect paths, project name, product doc sources; optional CLI ast+heuristic structural baseline

Phase K1 → Architecture reverse-engineering: key file extraction → layered analysis → component relation matrix
                                              ⛔ Confirmation point ① Architecture understanding

Phase K2 → Document generation (parallel batches):
             Batches 1~4: Type-4 component documents (dispatched to parallel sub-agents)
                                              ⛔ Confirmation point ② Document quality spot check
             Batches 5~7: architecture overview + bridge documents + knowledge enhancement

Phase K3 → AI-Native enhancement:
             search-anchor + bidirectional links + retrieval routing rules
             Graph RAG graph document set G1~G9 (three-state confidence labels)

Phase K4 → Quality assessment:
             validate_kb.py automatic checks
             Whole-base accuracy audit ([UNVERIFIED] statistics + interface coverage)
             Cross-document consistency check (contradiction detection + automatic fixes)
             RAG retrieval spot check (7 question types)
             AI end-to-end validation (10~15 standard questions + code trace-back)
             Quality report generation
```

Supports `--update` incremental updates (based on a file hash cache, rerunning only changed components).
