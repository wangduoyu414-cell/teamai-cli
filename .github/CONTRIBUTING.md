# Contributing to TeamAI CLI

Thanks for your interest in improving TeamAI! This document explains how to get a dev environment running, how to structure changes, and how to get your PR merged.

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tencent/teamai-cli.git
cd teamai-cli
npm install
```

### Common commands

```bash
npm run build          # Build with tsup → dist/
npx tsc --noEmit       # Type check
npm run lint           # oxlint; CI fails on any warning
npx vitest run         # Run unit tests
npx vitest run --coverage
npm run test:e2e       # E2E tests (optional, requires a live test repo)
```

`npm run lint` needs Node ^20.19 or >=22.12 (oxlint's requirement); the CLI itself still supports Node 20.

### Running your local build

```bash
npm run build && npm link
teamai --version
```

### Dogfood against a public team repo

All contributors should exercise pull, hooks, and recall while developing the CLI. Create a **regular** (not template) public team repo under [teamai-hub](https://github.com/teamai-hub), e.g. `https://github.com/teamai-hub/teamai-cli-dev`, with `main` branch protection (PR + review). Put only public-safe skills / rules / docs there.

In the **CLI clone** (not as `teamai init .`):

```bash
npm run build && npm link
teamai init https://github.com/teamai-hub/teamai-cli-dev --scope project --role dev
teamai pull
git status   # nothing under .teamai/ or tool dirs should be staged for this repo
```

Pitfalls:

- Init the **canonical hub URL**, not a personal fork. `teamai init <url>` treats that URL as the team repo; a fork diverges immediately, and GitHub push/PR today targets the configured remote (no fork-to-upstream flow).
- Do **not** run `teamai init .`. That is single-repo mode: it turns the CLI source tree into the team repo and writes scaffolding at the repo root (easy to commit by mistake).
- `Push failed (you can push manually later)` on member registration is **expected** without write access. Local config is still saved; `teamai pull` still works.

#### Write access and team stats

`digest` / `dashboard` read `stats/`, `sessions/`, and `members/` from the team repo. Those files are written via git, so **no write ⇒ not in team stats**.

Giving every internet contributor write on the hub repo is not acceptable.

| Who | Hub repo access | Required setup | In team digest |
|-----|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Contributors | read | `init` + `pull` | no |
| Collaborators (after a few PRs) | write, `main` protected | full, including reports | yes |

## Project Layout

```
src/
  providers/         # git hosting provider abstraction
    github/          # GitHub (gh CLI or GITHUB_TOKEN)
    tgit/            # Tencent TGit (gf CLI)
  resources/         # per-resource-type handlers (skills, rules, docs, env, ...)
  utils/             # shared helpers (git, fs, logger, prompt, ...)
  *.ts               # top-level command entry points (init, push, pull, ...)
```

See [docs/providers.md](../docs/providers.md) for how to add a new git provider.

## Making a Change

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch from the latest `origin/main`. Prefer a git worktree for code changes when practical.
2. Write tests for your change (we target 80%+ coverage).
3. Run `npx vitest run`, `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run lint` — all must pass.
4. Use conventional commits where possible: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`.
5. Open a PR with a clear description: what's the problem, what's the fix, anything reviewers should pay attention to.

Your PR also gets an informational `Code Erosion` report (SlopCodeBench verbosity/erosion metrics) posted as a comment — it never blocks the merge and is just there to flag creeping complexity. See [docs/ci-code-erosion.md](../docs/ci-code-erosion.md).

## Coding Style

- TypeScript strict mode is on; avoid `any` unless genuinely needed.
- Prefer async/await over callbacks.
- Keep commands in `src/*.ts` thin — heavy lifting lives in `src/resources/` or `src/utils/`.
- Avoid narrating comments ("// increment counter"). Comments should explain _why_, not _what_.

## Testing Guidelines

- Unit tests go in `src/__tests__/`. Mirror the source file name (`init.ts` → `init.test.ts`).
- Mock external I/O (git, fetch, child_process) at the module boundary.
- Avoid relying on real network access unless guarded by an env variable (like `TEAMAI_TEST_TOKEN`).

## Bug Reports & Feature Requests

Please file issues at [github.com/Tencent/teamai-cli/issues](https://github.com/Tencent/teamai-cli/issues). Include:

- What you tried to do
- What happened (error output, stack trace)
- What you expected
- Your OS, Node.js version, and `teamai --version`
