Make every AI coding agent work by the same harness.

Git-native management of skills, rules, and docs across Claude Code / Codex / CodeBuddy / WorkBuddy and more.

For you or your whole team.

> This fork is the pinned TeamAI Core used by the Autocode resource repository. It keeps upstream v0.20.0 behavior while adding strict host-aware Agent rendering and manifest-backed resource lifecycle safety. Version `0.20.0-autocode.2` adds explicit-only WorkBuddy/DeepSeek Harness static-resource adapters, persisted host-root drift protection, and DSH `0.1.1-rc.1` contract diagnostics. It is installed from an immutable commit archive, not from npm.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
TEAMAI_CORE_COMMIT=<commit-from-teamai-core.lock.json>
npm install -g "https://github.com/wangduoyu414-cell/teamai-cli/archive/${TEAMAI_CORE_COMMIT}.tar.gz"
```

### Team admin / solo user

Create a shared-experience repo on your git host (GitHub, TGit, or CNB), **grant write access to team members**, then have them run `teamai init https://github.com/yourorg/yourrepo`.

> Solo use needs no separate repo setup: `teamai init` checks the target repo and creates it automatically if it doesn't exist.

> **No team repo yet?** Start from a template pre-loaded with production-ready skills, rules, and review agents. Browse the [teamai-hub](https://github.com/teamai-hub) org, click **Use this template**, then `teamai init` against your new repo.

### Team members

```bash
# Project-scope init (default, resources installed under the project directory)
cd /path/to/my-project
teamai init https://github.com/yourorg/yourrepo

# User-scope init (resources installed under ~/)
teamai init https://github.com/yourorg/yourrepo --scope user

# Optional layered setup: keep a project repo active while inheriting safe
# resources and searchable knowledge from an initialized user-scope repo
cd /path/to/my-project
teamai init https://github.com/yourorg/project-repo --inherit-user-scope
```

Once initialized, every AI session automatically pulls the latest skills / rules and other Harness updates published by admins — no manual sync needed.

### Single-repo mode (the business repo *is* the team repo)

No separate team repo. Run `teamai init .` inside an existing project and its own git repo becomes the team repo:

```bash
cd /path/to/my-project
teamai init .                        # interactive: pick which AI tools to set up
teamai init . --agent claude,codex   # non-interactive: Claude Code + Codex
```

- **Knowledge** (skills / rules / docs / learnings) is committed to your repo's **main branch** under `.teamai/`, so a plain `git clone` already carries the whole team setup.
- **Reports** (member registrations, session summaries, votes, usage stats) go to a separate **`teamai-reports` orphan branch** — they never touch main.
- **You choose which AI tools to set up.** `--agent claude,codex` (repeatable/comma-separated), an interactive picker when omitted, or — in non-interactive contexts — whichever tools you already use under `~/`. teamai creates each selected tool's dir, injects hooks, and commits its settings.
- **Clone = initialized.** When a teammate clones the repo, the next `teamai` command (or AI session) auto-detects the `mode: self` marker in `.teamai/teamai.yaml` and finishes local setup automatically — no need to re-type repo/role.
- All of teamai's git operations run in isolated worktrees, so your working tree and current branch are never touched.

`teamai init .` commits `.teamai/` (skills, rules, docs, learnings, `teamai.yaml`, `.gitignore`) plus each selected tool's settings (e.g. `.claude/settings.json`, `.codex/hooks.json`) for you; just push main so teammates get auto-initialized on clone.

## Harness Management & Distribution

TeamAI keeps skills, rules, docs, and hooks in a shared git repo and distributes them to every member's local AI tools through a "push → review & merge → pull" flow — with support for subscribing to other teams' Harness.

### How It Works

```
teamai push → create branch + MR → reviewer approves + merges
                                         ↓
              SessionStart hook → teamai pull → synced to local AI tools
```

Members push changes via `teamai push`, which opens a Merge Request for review. Once merged, `teamai pull` (triggered automatically on session start via the SessionStart hook) syncs the latest resources locally. Skills sync to `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/`, `~/.cursor/skills/`, `~/.codebuddy/skills/`, etc.

### Team Hooks

Declare custom hooks in `hooks/hooks.yaml` and `teamai pull` delivers them to every AI tool:

```yaml
hooks:
  - id: block-secret
    description: Scan for secrets before commit
    event: PreToolUse
    matcher: Bash
    command: 'bash -lc "~/.teamai/team-scripts/scan-secret.sh" || true'
    tools: [claude, cursor]
```

```bash
teamai hooks list      # list effective hooks
teamai hooks inject    # re-reconcile into every installed tool
teamai hooks remove    # remove all teamai-managed hooks
```

### Team MCP Servers

Declare once in `mcp/mcp.yaml`; `teamai pull` writes each tool's native config. Use `${VAR}` for secrets.

```yaml
servers:
  - name: gpu-analysis
    transport: http            # stdio | http | sse
    url: https://example.com/api/mcp
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer ${GPU_ANALYSIS_TOKEN}
```

```bash
teamai mcp list | inject | remove
```

### Cross-team Skill Subscription

Subscribe to other teams' public skill repos:

```bash
teamai source add https://github.com/other-team/teamai-public.git --name other-team
teamai source list
teamai source browse other-team    # browse available skills
teamai source remove other-team
```

Subscribed skills sync automatically on `teamai pull`.

## Knowledge Base

Beyond distributing the Harness, TeamAI organizes accumulated team experience and code structure into a searchable knowledge base that the AI recalls automatically when needed.

### Automatic Experience Sharing

When a session ends, the Stop hook scores it by **friction** — signals that the session hit something worth remembering: you interrupted or corrected the AI, denied a tool call, or the AI had to retry failing tools. A long-but-routine session (lots of tool calls, no friction) does not trigger; a session where you actually fought a problem does. If the score is high enough, the AI suggests:

```
[teamai] This session may contain a problem worth documenting: you interrupted the AI twice, the AI retried failing tools 8 times.

Task: Fix duplicate project-level Hook injection

Consider running /teamai-share-learnings to summarize what you learned and share it with your team.
```

The hint names the non-zero friction signals that triggered it and, when available, includes a redacted, single-line summary of the first task. The `/teamai-share-learnings` skill summarizes the session and pushes a learning document directly to the team repo. Each session is prompted at most once.

### Team Knowledge Recall

Let the AI automatically search accumulated team knowledge before a task. This feature is **off by default** and must be enabled explicitly — teams can set `sharing.recall.enabled: true` in `teamai.yaml` as the default, and members can override locally:

```bash
teamai recall enable     # on: deploy the teamai-recall subagent + inject guidance rules
teamai recall disable    # off: remove the subagent and rules
teamai recall status     # show effective state (team default + user override)
```

**Search runs via a subagent**: once enabled, `teamai pull` deploys the built-in `teamai-recall` subagent into each AI tool's `agents/` directory. The AI invokes it before a task — the subagent extracts keywords, runs the search, reads the matched source files, and returns a structured summary of team knowledge. The subagent first runs a relevance precheck (`teamai recall --check`) and skips retrieval entirely when the task is unrelated to team knowledge. Under the hood it shells out to the `teamai recall` command, which you can also run manually:

```bash
$ teamai recall "port conflict"
[1/2] MR review caught a port-conflict bug ★1 [user]
Author: member-a | Score: 18.5 | Tags: troubleshooting, networking

[2/2] Deployment configuration best practices [project]
Author: member-b | Score: 12.0 | Tags: deploy, config
Matched: conflict | Missing: port
```

A `Matched: … | Missing: …` line appears whenever a hit does not cover every
query term (omitted when all terms matched). Recall returns its top matches by
score without filtering on coverage: a hit missing all of your distinctive
terms is topically adjacent, not an answer. Judging that is the caller's job —
the score alone cannot express it. Entries matching on title, date, author and
content are collapsed, so the same learning shared twice does not occupy two
slots.

**Coverage spans two parts:**

- **Shared search index** (`search-index.json`): four categories — learnings (session experience), docs (team docs), rules (coding rules), and skills (each `SKILL.md`) — sourced from the corresponding team-repo directories, (re)built on `teamai pull` / `teamai contribute`.
- **Codebase knowledge graph** (`teamwiki/`): produced by `teamai import`, queried live at search time.

Ranking uses BM25 + graph-boost. When the current working directory contains a project-scope config, Recall searches that project; if the project enables `--inherit-user-scope`, it then searches user knowledge, tags each result with its origin, and lets an identical project entry override the user entry. Without a project config in the current directory, Recall searches the user scope. Active-scope hits are implicitly upvoted; inherited user hits remain read-only while the project is active.

### Codebase Knowledge Graph

`teamai import` parses source repos into a structured graph under `teamwiki/`, enabling structurally-aware retrieval:

```bash
teamai import --from-repo https://github.com/org/repo
teamai import --from-org myorg              # batch import all repos
teamai codebase --lint                      # health check
```

The graph stores components, interfaces, configs, and cross-repo import edges. `teamai recall` uses it for graph-boosted re-ranking.
When a recall hit comes from a codebase page, the result includes a `Sources:` line listing the relevant source file paths — giving agents a direct starting point for code changes instead of re-exploring the repo.
