 *      the default branch's history for that path after the revision the
 *      push branch was built on has landed — the PR merged,
 *      however the platform merged it — and becomes a record. The path merely
 *      existing is not enough: another member may have created it after the
 *      PR was closed, and recording it then would hand their file to this
 *      author. Nothing is recorded before landing, so a PR closed unmerged
 *      leaves no record whether or not its branch was deleted, and no provider
 *      has to be asked whether a PR is open. While the PR is open the pending
 *      entry itself routes the author's edits back to it (`reuseRecordedDestinations`).
 *      Recording consumes the mark, so a placement is recorded exactly once,
 *      and a placement whose path was deleted after it landed is spent unrecorded.
 *   2. A record whose file is gone from the default branch is dropped: the
 *      team deleted the resource. Kept, it would come true again the day
 *      another member creates that path, and their unrelated resource would
 *      then read as this author's. For the same reason a record whose file
 *      was deleted since the last check (`placementsCheckedAt`) is dropped
 *      even when the path exists again.
 *   3. In legacy mode (no roles, no projects; asked of `deliversEveryNamespace`
 *      only when a shared-root file is there), a record whose
 *      bare name is now ALSO a shared-root file is dropped, with a warning: the
 *      author's root copy can no longer stand for the namespaced resource,
 *      because every namespace ships there and the shared-root rule of that
 *      name is what every tool dir holds at that path, so following the record
 *      would push that unrelated rule over the author's namespaced one. With
 *      roles or projects the recorded resource replaces the shared-root one of
 *      its name instead, as an active namespace's would (#707), and the record
 *      stays.
 *
 * Runs after the pull in `push` and after the refresh in `pull`, before
 * anything reads the records. Returns whether `state` changed.
 *
 * `tip` names the default branch as a git ref, for a checkout that is not the
 * default branch itself — a single-repo member's own working tree. Without
 * it, the working tree and HEAD are the default branch as just pulled.
