 *
 * `platform` is injectable because CI only runs ubuntu/macos: hardcoding
 * `process.platform` would leave the Windows branch permanently uncovered,
 * which is how #682 went unnoticed. Same pattern as `resolveCliPath` in

 *
 * `SHELL` is checked before the platform branch, on every platform: a zsh
 * installed via MSYS2/Cygwin on Windows sets `SHELL` just like it does on
 * POSIX, and native Windows Node still reports `platform === 'win32'` in
 * that case. Deferring to the Windows branch unconditionally would silently
 * stop loading `.zshrc` for that setup, even though `SHELL`-based detection
 * already got it right.
 *
 * On Windows, when `SHELL` does not indicate zsh, `SHELL` is otherwise never
 * set, so the POSIX logic below always fell back to `~/.bashrc` — but Git
 * Bash starts as a *login* shell, which reads `~/.bash_profile`,
 * `~/.bash_login` or `~/.profile`, never `~/.bashrc`. The block was written
 * correctly and looked correct on inspection, yet no shell ever sourced it.
 * This mirrors Git for Windows' own fallback in
 * `/etc/profile.d/bash_profile.sh`: it only generates a `.bash_profile` that
 * sources `.bashrc` when none of the three files exist, so preferring an
 * existing one of them — and falling back to `.bashrc` only when none exist —
 * agrees with what Git for Windows itself will end up sourcing.
