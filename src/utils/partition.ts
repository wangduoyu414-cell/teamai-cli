/**
 * Per-project data partition identity (issue #374 P1).
 *
 * teamai keys a project's machine-local data by the SHARED `projectAnchor` (the
 * main checkout, so every linked worktree resolves to the same partition), NOT
 * the per-worktree workspace root. The partition lives at
 * `~/.teamai/projects/<slug>/`, entirely outside the business workspace.
 *
 * slug(anchor) = <safe-path>-<sha256(normalized anchor) first 16 hex>
 *
 * The prefix is the WHOLE anchor path made filesystem-safe (leading separator
 * dropped, path separators → `-`), so the directory name reads back to the
 * project it belongs to — mirroring how Claude Code names `~/.claude/projects/`.
 * It is a human-readable convenience only; the trailing hash is what guarantees
 * uniqueness. A raw path escape alone is NOT injective (`/x/my-proj` and
 * `/x/my/proj` would collide after `/`→`-`), so the sha256 suffix breaks any
 * such collision. The prefix is length-bounded (the hash still disambiguates
 * when two long paths share a truncated head), and the authoritative reverse
 * lookup remains the `anchor` file, not the (lossy, one-way) directory name.
 *
 * Partitions written before #546 used the `<safe-basename>-<hash>` format; the
 * hash is unchanged, so those are adopted in place (renamed to the current
 * name) by `resolvePartitionDir` and still recognized by `status --all` via
 * `legacyProjectSlug` — no data is stranded by the widening.

 *
 * Both names share the same sha256 suffix, so an anchor's legacy name is
 * computable exactly — no directory scanning. When the canonical
 * (current-format) directory does not exist yet and a legacy-named one does,
 * the legacy partition is RENAMED into place: an atomic, same-parent metadata
 * move, so no data is copied and an interrupted adoption leaves either name
 * intact, never a half-moved directory. Every seam that resolves "this
 * project's partition" (detection, init, migration) goes through here, so an
 * upgraded CLI converges on the new name on the first command that touches the
 * project. `status --all` deliberately does NOT rename (it must stay
 * read-only); it recognizes the legacy name via `legacyProjectSlug` instead.
 *
 * Edge cases:
 *  - canonical already exists with data → it is authoritative; a leftover
 *    legacy dir is left untouched for `status --all` / manual cleanup (same
 *    rule as migration: never overwrite an authoritative partition).
 *  - canonical exists but is EMPTY (a crashed init's bare mkdir) while the
 *    legacy partition holds the data → the empty dir is replaced. POSIX
 *    rename already does this in one call; Windows (which refuses to rename
 *    onto an existing dir) takes the explicit rmdir-then-rename path.
 *  - rename genuinely impossible (e.g. read-only home) and legacy exists →
 *    the legacy directory keeps serving as the partition, so no data is
 *    stranded and nothing pretends to be fresh.
 *
 * The microscopic race (two processes adopting at once) is benign: the loser
 * observes the legacy name gone, finds the canonical name in place, and lands
 * on the same directory.
 *
 * Whenever the resolution lands on `canonical`, the stored `repo.localPath` is
 * rebased off the legacy directory (see `rebaseLocalPathAfterAdoption`): the
 * team-repo clone lived at `<legacyDir>/team-repo` as an ABSOLUTE path in
 * config.yaml, so a bare directory rename would leave the config pointing at a
 * now-gone path and every later `pull` would silently skip the sync. The
 * rewrite is idempotent, so it also finishes an adoption that crashed between
 * the rename and the config rewrite.
 *
 * Under `dryRun` it renames and rewrites nothing, so a preview reads the
 * partition where it is.
