 * payload; all log lines go to STDERR (see setStderrOnly below).
 *
 * Foreground vs background:
 *   Handlers that may return output the host injects back into the session run
 *   inline (foreground). Pure side-effect handlers (version check, dashboard,
 *   local-agent) are marked `background` and run in a detached child process so
 *   a slow registry/network call cannot delay the host's hook completion —
 *   critical for CodeBuddy's 10s hook timeout. Detaching also survives the
 *   caller's process.exit(0) (index.ts), which otherwise kills in-process
 *   fire-and-forget work before it finishes.

 *     `-WindowStyle Hidden` only hides it once PowerShell has started (the

 *   - the creating PowerShell runs with `windowsHide` (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), so not
 *     even it flashes.
 *
 * WMI has no STDIN pipe, so `stdin` travels as a temp file named on the command
 * line (`--stdin-file`); the child reads and removes it (readStdinFile).
